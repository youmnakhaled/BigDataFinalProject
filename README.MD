# “Instacart Market Basket Order Prediction”

This is a group project made by a group of four students taking the Big Data and Analytics Course at Cairo University.

Instacart is a grocery shopping service. Users order their groceries
through an app. The Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset was engineered
for a specific application: to try to predict which items a customer would order
again in the future.

This is a classification problem. Our goal is to predict whether a customer
will reorder a product based on his prior purchases.
Using the dataset mentioned below, we will be able to predict the next order of
the customer based on his behaviors.


We have successfully integrated spark with this task to get a fully working pipeline that can predict reorder of a specific product with accuracy up to 96.67%.
